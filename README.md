# Full stack open bootcamp

## Description

Learn React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript in one go! This course will introduce you to modern JavaScript-based web development. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.

The motivation for doing this bootcamp is to review the fundamental bases of development and delve into fields where I do not have work experience, such as backend or databases.

At the same time, this project helps to improve my daily work as a frontend by seeing different solutions to problems that I have already faced on other occasions.

## Credits

I would like to express my gratitude to [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) for their invaluable resources and comprehensive course on full-stack development. Their commitment to providing high-quality education has been instrumental in shaping my skills and knowledge in the field.
